# torpedo

Connect to databases in private VPCs the easy way - no VPN required

## How it works

On first run, `torpedo` will create an ECS cluster (this does not cost anything). From there, any time you want to connect to a database `torpedo` will generate random SSH keys, spin up a temporary container that has access to your database, and forward a local port through it. Then you can connect to the database on `localhost` as though it were running locally. The container will be destroyed once you're done with your session.

## Usage

Make sure you have a default AWS profile set or manually set one with `AWS_PROFILE=xxx torpedo`

```shell
$ torpedo
ðŸš€ torpedo is ready

connect to port 5432 on localhost
it's forwarded to main-1.cz73excokyft.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432

press ctrl+c to exit
```

## Acknowledgements

This wasn't my idea! There is a much more fleshed out product called `7777` here: [https://port7777.com/](https://port7777.com/) by [Matthieu Napoli](https://mnapoli.fr/) and [Marco AurÃ©lio Deleu](https://blog.deleu.dev/). `torpedo` works in a similar way but was rewritten in Go for faster bootup speeds and made open source for community contribution.
